# CampusConnect Reimagined (Loveable.ai Version)

CampusConnect is a student networking app that helps students discover, connect, and interact with peers on campus. The frontend was generated using Loveable.ai to quickly create a polished interface, while I implemented the backend using Supabase and integrated Stripe for secure payments. This allowed us to launch a functional MVP in time for competitions and online deployment.
